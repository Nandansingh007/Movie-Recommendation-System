# Movie-Recommendation-System


# Project Overview

The Movie Recommendation System is a content-based filtering application that utilizes the TMDB dataset to suggest personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and past interactions. The system implements a content-based approach, leveraging movie features such as overviews, genres, keywords, cast, and crew details to calculate movie similarity and provide relevant suggestions. By the end of the project, users will have an enhanced movie-watching experience with tailored movie recommendations.
